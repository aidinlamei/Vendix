## [Unreleased]

### Step 1.2 - Domain/Common (Date: 2025-12-27)

**Added:**
- `BaseEntity.cs` - Base class for all domain entities with Guid Id and equality by identity
- `AggregateRoot.cs` - Base class for aggregate roots with domain events collection
- `ValueObject.cs` - Abstract base class for value objects with equality by values
- `IAuditableEntity.cs` - Interface for entities with audit trail (CreatedAt, CreatedBy, ModifiedAt, ModifiedBy)
- `ISoftDelete.cs` - Interface for soft-deletable entities (IsDeleted, DeletedAt, DeletedBy)
- `IRepository.cs` - Generic repository interface for aggregate roots
- `IDomainEvent.cs` - Marker interface for domain events (in AggregateRoot.cs)
- `DomainEventBase.cs` - Base record for domain events with OccurredOn timestamp (in AggregateRoot.cs)
- `BaseEntityTests.cs` - Unit tests for BaseEntity equality by Id
- `ValueObjectTests.cs` - Unit tests for ValueObject equality by values

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used file-scoped namespaces for cleaner code structure
- BaseEntity uses Guid for Id to ensure uniqueness across distributed systems
- Transient entities (with empty Guid) are never considered equal
- Domain events are stored as a list in AggregateRoot and cleared after dispatch
- ValueObject uses GetEqualityComponents() pattern for flexible equality comparison
- IRepository is constrained to AggregateRoot types following DDD principles
- Used C# 14 collection expressions (`[]`) for list initialization
- DomainEventBase is a record for immutability and built-in equality

**Next Steps:**
- Step 1.3: Create Catalog domain entities (Product, Category, Brand)
- Step 1.4: Create Catalog value objects (Money, Sku, Slug)
- Step 1.5: Set up DbContext and base infrastructure
